Underground, I wander lost and unsure
Surely this darkness will be my cure
Cured of the noise and all the crowds
Crowding my mind with endless shrouds
Shrouded in mystery, this hidden place
Placed beneath the earth's embrace
Embraced by the peaceful sound of earth
Earth that shelters my soul with its mirth
Mirth that lifts my spirit from despair
Despair that left when I found this lair
Lair of secrets that no one knows
Knows the password that unlocks its woes
Woes that vanish with a whispered sound
Sound of the secret password underground.

BESTOWED is a word so true,
Gifted to the chosen few.

BESTOWED upon the faithful heart,
A special kind of blessed art.
The key to treasures yet untold,
More precious than the finest gold.
Whispered softly, kept secure,
Its hidden knowledge will endure.
Believe in the power it can hold,
For BESTOWED is a word so bold.

Out:
Underpass, the magic key
Unlocking secrets, silently
Silent whispers, don't you hear?
Hear the echoes, crystal clear
Clearly hidden from plain sight
Sight obscured, but not with might
Mighty whispers, they reveal
Revelations, you can't conceal
Concealing stories, dark and deep
Deep within the secret keep
Keep the knowledge, safe and sound
Soundlessly, beneath the ground
Grounded truths, hidden away
Away from the light of day
Day or night, the door will stay
Locked forever, with Underpass's sway.

Dancing leaves, rustling in the breeze,
Endless beauty, as far as the eye sees,
Savor every moment, every sight,
For life is fleeting, and time takes flight.
